# MathQuest Product Roadmap

## Product objective

MathQuest should help Sienna, a Grade 5 learner currently needing targeted Number and Algebra support, improve through short daily tutoring sessions. It should align to Victorian Curriculum Level 5 while adapting across Levels 2–6 from a diagnostic baseline.

The target experience is not a digital worksheet. Each session should diagnose, explain, let Sienna manipulate a mathematical model, ask her to reason, provide progressively stronger help only when needed, and revisit the skill later to confirm retention.

## Current release scope, 0.21.0

This release replaces the limited legacy manipulative panel with a React-owned Interactive Maths Lab available from every worksheet question.

- Provide learner-controlled fraction bars, comparison models and equivalent-fraction exploration using equal-sized wholes.
- Link percentage, fraction, decimal and quantity representations so one adjustment updates every form.
- Provide open number-line markers and positive or negative jumps for addition and subtraction strategies.
- Provide place-value columns and visual quantities for thousands, hundreds, tens and ones.
- Provide configurable arrays and equal groups for multiplication and division.
- Provide an interactive analogue clock linked to a digital time.
- Provide a selectable labelled grid for coordinate and grid-reference exploration.
- Provide rectangle, ruler and angle controls for measurement, perimeter, area and angle reasoning.
- Make every model available from every question while recommending the most relevant starting model.
- Include **Start over** within the lab and make the layout usable on desktop, mobile and Home Assistant.
- **Guided-tutor follow-up:** route Algebra multiplication and division fact questions to arithmetic support instead of unknown-equation support.
- **Answer-protection follow-up:** reject worked examples whose assessed inputs or final answer collide with the current question.
- **Worksheet-flow follow-up:** do not allow tutor **Start over** to clear a final result and strand the learner on a completed question.
- Add component, interaction, answer-protection and regression coverage for the complete release scope.

## Recently completed release, 0.20.0

- Three progressively stronger ask-before-tell hint stages.
- Question-specific guidance across representative mathematics families.
- **Why?**, **Teach me this**, **Show another way** and **Start over** tutor actions.
- Different-number worked examples, misconception routing and read-aloud tutor support.

## Feature findings from the supplied recordings

### Dynamic visual learning, inspired by the percentage demonstration

- Interactive percentage bars with draggable endpoints and linked numeric values.
- Multiple representations of the same concept, such as percentage, fraction, bar length and quantity.
- Immediate visual feedback when a model is changed.
- A visible learning pathway with small lessons and mastery checkpoints.
- A **Why?** explanation that can be opened without leaving the problem.
- **Start over** for resetting a model and trying a different strategy.
- Progressive examples that move from simple benchmark percentages to less obvious values.
- Correctness feedback attached to the model, not only to a text answer.

### Guided tutoring and manipulatives, inspired by the fraction demonstration

- Brief concept explanation followed immediately by a comprehension check.
- Tutor dialogue that asks Sienna to reason instead of revealing the answer.
- Virtual fraction tiles and area models that can be copied, split, moved and compared.
- On-demand manipulatives selected for the current misconception.
- A sequence of explain, try, inspect, prompt, retry and reflect.
- Optional read-aloud narration with synchronised visual steps.
- Positive feedback and small moments of celebration without distracting from the maths.
- Mixed response modes, including manipulation, multiple choice, typed values and spoken reasoning later.

## Consolidated feature backlog

### Learning foundation

- Diagnostic baseline mapped to Victorian Curriculum outcomes across Levels 2–6.
- Level 5 target pathway with prerequisite links to earlier concepts.
- Time-based 5, 10 and 15-minute sessions instead of relying only on fixed 20-question worksheets.
- Outcome-level mastery based on accuracy, independence, hint use, fluency and retention.
- Real spaced-retrieval scheduling with due dates for each skill.
- Automatic selection of prerequisite teaching when a misconception is detected.
- Number and Algebra intervention pathway covering all four operations, fact families, written methods and unknown-value equations.

### Teaching and hints

- Three-stage hints: a conceptual cue, a strategy or visual prompt, then a worked next step.
- Question-type-specific hints for arithmetic, fractions, measurement, grids, time, data and equations.
- Guided tutor mode that asks one question at a time and does not expose the final answer prematurely.
- Short worked examples using different numbers from the assessed question.
- **Why?**, **Teach me this**, **Show another way** and **Start over** actions.
- Read-aloud for prompts, hints and explanations.
- Confidence and misconception checks that influence the current session.

### Interactive mathematical models

- Fraction tiles, fraction walls, area models and equivalent-fraction builders.
- Fraction-comparison bars stacked vertically, aligned to the same origin and scaled to an equal whole so relative amounts can be compared directly.
- Percentage bars linked to fractions, decimals and quantities.
- Open number lines and jump strategies for addition and subtraction.
- Place-value blocks and regrouping models for written operations.
- Arrays and equal-group models for multiplication and division.
- Interactive analogue clocks, rulers, grids, coordinates, angles and data charts.
- Scratchpad, drawing and reusable manipulatives available from every question.

### Applied practice and engagement

- Story Adventures 2.0 with a coherent multi-question narrative, themed data and a final mission outcome.
- Story difficulty and learning outcomes selected from Sienna's current goals.
- Everyday word problems involving money, time, recipes, travel, sport and data.
- Choice of standard practice, guided lesson, Story Adventure or review session.
- Meaningful progress celebrations tied to mastery and persistence rather than only XP.

### Learner experience

- Clear session goal and estimated duration before starting.
- Previous, next, skip, finish-with-skipped and restart-skipped lifecycle.
- Resume the exact worksheet, question, answer draft and elapsed time.
- Accessible mobile and Home Assistant layouts.

## Release sequence and delivery gates

Calendar estimates are intentionally excluded. MathQuest releases can be developed quickly, while the meaningful delivery constraint is the review and real-world testing gate. The roadmap is therefore an ordered queue, not a dated schedule.

| Order | Release | Focus | Delivery gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Completed | 0.17.2 | Calendar, worksheet completion/restart, Story Adventures and roadmap | Merged and released |
| Completed | 0.18.0 | Frontend and worksheet foundation | Merged and released |
| Completed | 0.19.0 | Diagnostic and timed tutoring | Merged and released |
| Completed | 0.19.1 | Grid and fraction visual correctness | Merged and released |
| Completed | 0.20.0 | Guided tutor and scaffolded hints | Merged and released |
| Current | 0.21.0 | Interactive maths lab | Fractions, percentages, number lines, place value, arrays, clocks, grids and measurement manipulatives work across desktop, mobile and Home Assistant; guided-tutor follow-up defects are corrected |
| Next | 0.22.0 | Story Adventures 2.0 | Coherent missions use the selected theme, current learning goals, themed data and applied multi-step problems from start to finish |
| Then | 0.23.0 | Adaptive mastery and retention | Outcome mastery, prerequisite routing, review scheduling and confidence/fluency signals produce correct next-session recommendations |
| Then | 0.24.0 | Parent and Home Assistant insight | Growth reporting, recommendations, stable HA authentication and dashboard metrics remain correct through restart and upgrade testing |

### Continuous delivery loop

1. Lock the next release to a small, independently testable scope.
2. Develop the complete scope, including version references, changelog and documentation.
3. Run backend tests, frontend type/build checks, release validation and the relevant regression tests.
4. Open a draft pull request and stop for Stu's testing and review.
5. Fix findings on that same release branch until it passes.
6. After Stu merges the pull request, detect the merge and begin the next release in the queue.

No release receives a promised date or week count. The loop may complete several times in a day when development, automated checks and Stu's testing are all completed quickly. A release remains at its gate for as long as testing or correction requires.

### How new work enters the queue

- Critical security, data-loss or blocking reliability defects may interrupt the queue as a tightly scoped patch release.
- Ad-hoc bugs and enhancements reported during an active release are assessed and added to the next planned release development, rather than interrupting or reshuffling the release already underway.
- Related ad-hoc items may be grouped into that upcoming release when this makes implementation and testing more coherent.
- The active release remains scope-locked unless Stu explicitly asks to include an item, or the item is required for that release to function correctly.
- If a security, data-loss or application-blocking defect appears serious enough to interrupt the queue, raise it for Stu's decision before changing the release sequence.
- Every Home Assistant-delivered release must bump all required version references and changelog entries so the add-on detects the update.

The interactive maths lab remains dependent on the frontend architecture and automated interaction tests, but that dependency defines release order rather than elapsed time.

## Recommended priority

The current release should deliver and validate the 0.21.0 Interactive Maths Lab. The key educational gate is that Sienna can manipulate multiple connected representations, reset and retry them, and access the relevant model without leaving a question. The three guided-tutor defects found after v0.20.0 merged are included under the agreed ad-hoc intake rule. After this release is merged, 0.22.0 should begin Story Adventures 2.0 and include compatible ad-hoc items accepted while 0.21.0 was underway.
